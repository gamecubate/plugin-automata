# CellularAutomaton - plugin for ImpactJS #

A cellular automaton plugin for the Impact javascript game engine (http://impactjs.com/). The base class, Automaton, extends ig.Class and maintains a population of cells, some alive and the rest dead, the status of which it updates every time its step function is invoked. Subclasses should override this function to provide their own behaviour. One such subclass, Conway, is provided with this package and serves as a basic example. â€” Read more
